The first commit generates files with the command `ng new my-app`.

### Video: Angular from scratch, part 2 (Inspecting the boilerplate Angular app)

The second commit is a simplification of the main page and the `title` variable.

### Video: Angular from scratch, part 3 (how to generate a new Angular component)

The third commit is an example of how to generate a new component. To demo how it's done, I've ran `ng generate component navigation`.

The fourth commit is adding the custom `<app-navigation>` component to the AppComponent's template file. Also, some updates (namely, links) - are added to the NavigationComponent's template and css files.
